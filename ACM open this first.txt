Steps to run my code:

Well, its bad i know i tried react shadcn for frontend and express node for backend.

To run front end:
# cd to ironman director and then do npm run dev

To run back end:
# cd to ironman directory and then cd to backend directory and then type node server.js in another terminal

now you have the frontend and backend in two separate terminals, you should see the app in your localhost, but i know mostly it will fail cause node is such a pain so i have attached the photos of my webpage so i can get pity marks hehehe.
